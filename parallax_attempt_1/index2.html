       <h4>Life Within a Redwood Tree</h4>
       <div class="text">
       Every year, redwood trees shed their foliage. Each year, redwoods shed their foliage.
       <br />
       While some foliage falls to the ground, other foliage accumulates on large branches of the redwood and decomposes there into an organic soil called "<b>canopy soil</b>".
       <br />
       This creates a “mat”, high in the trees that allows a surface for plants and animals to congregate.
       <br />
       Seeds of plants and spores of fungi colonize this soil, creating a plant community high in the canopy of redwood trees. Plants that grow on trees are called <b>epiphytes</b>.
       <br /> 
       Since redwoods can live for thousands of years, this allowed for a very complex ecosystem of epiphytes and animal species to be created.
       Redwoods are so immense that large plants and even trees can grow in their canopy!

        <h4>Life on the Rooftops of Redwoods</h4>
        <div class="text">
        The rooftops of redwoods are also extremely vital for many birds who use it for nesting purposes.
        <br />
        These include the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocepahlus) Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and Fisher (Martes pennanti).
        <br />It is also possible that the California Condor(the largest flying bird) could have used these trees for nesting as well. It was documented that these birds used hollowed out sequoia trees in the sierra nevadas as nesting since they survived their longest.
        <br />
        Now, nearly extinct, it is vital that we preserve as much of their habitat as possible.

      <h4>River Habitat</h4>
      <div class="text">
      California rivers are extremely important to the biodiversity of the environment.
      <br />
      They contribute greatly to the global steelhead, salmon and other fish specie populations since these rivers are used for spawning.
      <br />These rivers also deliver precious sediment and nutrients downstream to trees and plants that need them to thrive. 
      <br />The river is a vital part of the entire ecosystem from mammals, fish to birds and insects.

        <h4>Grassland Habitats</h4>
        <div class="text">
        Native grasslands supported several herbivores including pronghorn antelope (Antilocarpa americana), elk (including a valley subspecies, the Tule Elk, (Cervus elaphus nannodes), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), California ground squirrels, gophers, mice, hare, rabbits, and kangaroo rats.

        Several rodents are endemics or near-endemics to southern valley habitats including the Fresno kangaroo rat (Dipodomys nitratoides exilis), Tipton kangaroo rat (Dipodomys nitratoides nitratoides), San Joaquin pocket mouse (Perognathus inornatus), and giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens). Predators once included grizzly bear, gray wolf, coyote, mountain lion, ringtail, bobcat, and the San Joaquin Valley kit fox (Vulpes velox), another southern valley-foothill endemic.
